The contents of this folder are going to get messy quickly.
That is intentional, considering that the prototype folder
is where all of our prototype python code will go, and where
anything goes, no matter how messy/hackish/disorganized/
awesome. As long as it is not in java.
remember -- "java" <=> "part (complete or not) of actual project".
