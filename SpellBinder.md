# SpellBinder Extended #

Spellbinder, aka Waving Hands, is a tabletop game designed by Richard Bartle, which is based on a unique approach to the act of casting spells. As anybody who has encountered the Naruto universe will know, spells can be casted by performing a series of small hand actions; for example, the well-known Sith-Lightning-Fingers-Point; or the Phoenix Fireflower jiutsu.

We aren't just blatantly copying, however -- we introduce an extension to spellbinder, involving more full-body actions; for physical combat and choreography (yes, you can dance if you like, but that achieves little apart from your entertainment). In addition to actions like "finger point" and "proferred palm", we include such staples as "swipe {limb} left" etc.
