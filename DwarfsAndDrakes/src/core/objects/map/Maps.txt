## How the Maps Work ##
There are two main kinds of map -- the Dungeon map, and the OverWorld map.

A finite map (that is, the dungeon map) is easy to simulate; but an infinite map 
(the OverWorld) not so much. So, here's the plan:

The OverWorld will be split into "chunks", finite blocks of overworld map; 
linked together in a WorldMap object.

Anyways -- The only part of the overworld which is simulated is the part visible 
to the player (perhaps with a buffer zone). Anyways, this means that we use an 
object which moves with the player; and this object is what keeps the monsters 
simulating.

We'll call this the ActiveMap or something -- on the overworld, this map follows 
the player, but in a dungeon it simulates the entire floor at once.
