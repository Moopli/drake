The contents of this folder are going to get messy quickly. That is intentional, 
considering that the prototype folder is where all of our prototype python code 
will go, and where anything goes, no matter how messy/hackish/disorganized/
awesome. As long as it is not in java. remember -- "java" <=> "part (complete or 
not) of actual project".
