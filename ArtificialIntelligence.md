As it is, we haven't really set on plans for intelligence -- whether it be individuals acting smartly, collaboration, emergent behavior, simulation of emergent phenomena (tribes etc) and so on. So for now this will serve as a bit of a BS session place.

One idea we had a while ago for an AI General Strategy:
  * Mobs will be handled using Finite-State-Automata (I have a system outlined in java already, but will python-prtotype to be sure it works)
  * Pathfinding to and away from Player will be handled by an odor-diffusion system
  * Adaptive enemies -- genetics and neural networks (the former much easier than the latter)
  * Mobs that cooperate (and not just through emergent behaviour) will come later, if at all. Emergent "collaboration" (that is, flanking, surrounding) based on dispersal effects may be all we need.
