### Internal Organs, Damage, and Cripples oh my! ###
Much thanks to Slaves to Armok: God of Blood II; Dwarf Fortress
  * Giant overworlds
  * HP-free damage systems
    * see [here](http://gamasutra.com/blogs/EricSchwarz/20121210/183199/DPS_and_the_Decline_of_Complexity_in_RPGs.php) for a parallel reason -- simplifying numbers lose out on interesting mechanics

### AI Ideas, Dev Planning, and a whole lot more ###

  * Monster AI
  * Finding/Following the Player
  * Variety (note the lack of HP in our game)
  * Dungeon Generation

### Dungeon Generation ###
http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Basic_BSP_Dungeon_generation
  * Method for generating constructed dungeons
  * Addition -- room can be furnished differently based on room size and level depth and other stuff -- eg: a large room on a deep enough level can be a throne room, with all the courtly accoutrements -- throne, pillars, metal king slime, etc.
    * This (and other stuff) could be accomplished using tile brushes and predicates (see http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=Designing_Flexible,_Reusable_Algorithms)
